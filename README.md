## Using this template
To create whitelabel docs for a given project, just run a global `cmd + f` on the word `todo`, and fill in all info. Should be quite self explanatory!

### Assets
Note: In addition to all todos, make sure to replace  `images/hub.png` and `images/faucet.png` with screenshots from the network's hub page. 

## Local Development

First, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.
